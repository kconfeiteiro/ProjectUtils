# Introduction

The purpose of this repository is just to include all of the small functions I use for multiple projects. Having them here allows me to simply clone the repository rather than copying the code for each project. This repository is a work in progress and I will be adding whichever functions I find are useful. As this repository grows, I will improve on its organization; it was thrown together quickly, so its organization is questionable, at best.

The `run_venv.bat` file can be ignored, that is what I use to activate the virtual environment which I use to test this code.

# Usage
All you need to do to use the functions is clone the repository locally by typing `https://github.com/kconfeiteiro/PyProjectUtils/edit/main/README.md` in your cmd (opened in your working directory). Then, you can call functions from the `PyProjectUtils` directory. 


# Issues and Collaboration
If there are any issues, bugs, or broken functions feel free to contact confeitk@outlook.com. Or, if you would like to add functions of your own, feel free to fork the repository!
