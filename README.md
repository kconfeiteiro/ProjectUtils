# Introduction

The purpose of this repository is just to include all of the small functions I use for multiple projects. Having them here allows me to simply clone the repository rather than copying the code for each project. This repository is a work in progress and I will be adding whichever functions I find are useful. As this repository grows, I will improve on its organization; it was thrown together quickly, so its organization is questionable, at best.

# Usage

All you need to do to use the functions is clone the repository locally by typing 

```
https://github.com/kconfeiteiro/PyProjectUtils/edit/main/README.md
```

 in your cmd (opened in your working directory). Then, you can call functions from the `PyProjectUtils` directory.

## Calling Functions

To call functions in your main script, use `from PyProjectUtils import Tools` (for example) to import an entire script. If you would like to call a specific class only, use `from PyProjectUtils.Utils.Tools import Tools` to import a single class.

## Pull requests

Pull requests are automatically completed. To pull new changes, use the command

```
cd PyProjectUtils & git pull https://github.com/kconfeiteiro/PyProjectUtils & cd ..
```

in your terminal (opened in your working directory). I found that this is the best method.

# Issues and Collaboration

If there are any issues, bugs, or broken functions feel free to contact confeitk@outlook.com. Or, if you would like to add functions of your own, feel free to fork the repository!
